Purpose of the Program:

The purpose is to emulate characteristics of sequences. It's suppose to be a raw sequence painting device
so that you can plug those sequences into program and have them play back. Polyphonically etc..

The backend is going to be run by a puredata script. The front end will be javascript, and all the
data analysis is going to be done by python.
